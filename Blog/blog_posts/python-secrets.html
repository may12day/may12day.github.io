<h1>Cool Hidden Features of CPython: Unveiling the Magic Behind Python</h1>

<p>Python is known for its simplicity and readability, but beneath its user-friendly surface lies a world of fascinating intricacies. Today, we're diving into CPython, the reference implementation of Python, to uncover some mind-blowing hidden features that will make you say, "<i>Wow, I didn't know Python could do that!</i>"</p>

<h2>1. The Secret __hello__ Function</h2>
<p>Did you know that Python has a built-in module that can generate a Zen of Python message? Try this in your Python interpreter :</p>
<pre><code class="python">
import __hello__</code></pre>
<p>Surprise! It prints "Hello world!". <br>
This quirky feature has been part of CPython since its early days, serving as both an inside joke and a simple test module.</p>

<h2>2. Memory-Efficient Integers</h2>
<p>CPython has a clever optimization for small integers. It pre-allocates integers from -5 to 256, meaning these numbers are always the same object in memory :</p>
<pre><code class="python">
a = 256
b = 256
print(a is b)  # True

c = 257
d = 257
print(c is d)  # False</code></pre>
<p>This optimization saves memory and speeds up operations with small numbers.</p>

<h2>3. Dynamic Attribute Access with getattr and getattribute</h2>
<p>CPython provides powerful mechanisms for customizing attribute access through special methods <span class="highlight">__getattr__</span> and <span class="highlight">__getattribute__</span>. These methods allow for dynamic attribute creation and can be used to implement some fascinating patterns. Here's an intriguing example :</p>
<pre><code class="python">
class DynamicAttributes:
    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        self.__dict__.update(kwargs)

    def __getattr__(self, name):
        return f"You tried to access '{name}', but it doesn't exist!"

    def __getattribute__(self, name):
        print(f"Accessing attribute: {name}")
        return super().__getattribute__(name)

obj = DynamicAttributes(x=1, y=2)
print(obj.x)  # Outputs: Accessing attribute: x \n 1
print(obj.z)  # Outputs: Accessing attribute: z \n You tried to access 'z', but it doesn't exist!</code></pre>
<p>In this example, <span class="highlight">__getattribute__</span> is called for every attribute access, allowing us to log all attribute accesses. <span class="highlight">__getattr__</span> is called only for attributes that don't exist, providing a custom message instead of raising an AttributeError.<br>
<br>
This feature allows for creative patterns like lazy loading of attributes, proxy objects, and even creating objects that can respond to any attribute name dynamically.</p>

<h2>4. Function Introspection with code</h2>
<p>CPython allows you to peek into the internals of a function using the <span class="highlight">__code__</span> attribute :</p>
<pre><code class="python">
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

print(greet.__code__.co_varnames)  # ('name',)
print(greet.__code__.co_code)  # b't\x00|\x00\x9b\x00d\x01\x9d\x03S\x00'</code></pre>

<p>The <span class="highlight">co_varnames</span> attribute returns a tuple of strings containing the names of local variables used in the function, which are stored in the __code__ object. <br>
<br>
The output <span class="highlight">b't\x00|\x00\x9b\x00d\x01\x9d\x03S\x00'</span> is the bytecode representation of the greet function, showing the low-level instructions that Python executes to run the function. This bytecode is a compact, platform-independent representation of the function's logic. <br>
<br>
This feature is incredibly useful for metaprogramming and creating advanced debugging tools.</p>

<h2>5. Constant Folding in AST Revealed by Bytecode</h2>
<p>CPython performs various optimizations during compilation, one of which is constant folding. This process evaluates constant expressions at compile time, improving runtime performance. <br>

Let's peek into this optimization using bytecode :</p>
<pre><code class="python">
import dis

def constant_folding():
    return 24 * 60 * 60

def no_folding(x):
    return x * 60 * 60

print(dis.dis(constant_folding))
print("\n")
print(dis.dis(no_folding))</code></pre>

Output :

<pre><code class="python">
2           0 LOAD_CONST               1 (86400)
            2 RETURN_VALUE

None

2           0 LOAD_FAST                0 (x)
            2 LOAD_CONST               1 (60)
            4 BINARY_MULTIPLY
            6 LOAD_CONST               1 (60)
            8 BINARY_MULTIPLY
            10 RETURN_VALUE

None</code></pre>
<p>In the <span class="highlight">constant_folding</span> function, CPython recognizes that <span class="highlight">24 * 60 * 60</span> is a constant expression and computes it at compile time. The bytecode shows a single <span class="highlight">LOAD_CONST</span> operation with the pre-computed value 86400. <br>
<br>
Conversely, in the <span class="highlight">no_folding</span> function, where <span class="highlight">x</span> is a variable, the bytecode shows separate load and multiply operations, as the computation must be done at runtime. <br>
<br>
This optimization showcases CPython's ability to enhance performance by doing work at compile time when possible, a feature not immediately apparent when writing Python code.</p>
